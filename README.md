# 🚀 BrightTV Viewership Analytics: Growth Strategy
This repository contains the analysis and strategic recommendations developed to assist BrightTV's Customer Value Management (CVM) team in achieving their subscription base growth objective.
## 🎯 Aim
The primary aim of this project is to provide actionable data-driven insights to BrightTV's CEO and CVM team that will guide efforts to significantly grow the company's subscription base during the current financial year. This involves analyzing user profiles and viewer transaction data to identify trends, consumption drivers, and opportunities for strategic intervention.
## 📰 Overview
This analysis is based on BrightTV's viewership data, focusing on performance, customer demographics, content preference, and viewing patterns.
## 💡 Key Insights 
### 📈 Key Growth Mandate Summary

* **Customer Growth:** Surged from 35% to 62% (February to March).
* **Regional Drivers:** Growth is anchored by key regional drivers, primarily Gauteng (37%) and Western Cape (18%) of total customers.
* **Audience Preference:** Clear preference for Short-Form content less than 15mins (52% of total views).
* **Engagement Peak:** Highest on Friday and Saturday (over 33% of weekly activity).


### 📊 Core Audience Profile & Viewing Behavior

* **Dominant Segment:** Young Adults (20-39) dominate with a 69% share and lead in short views at 58.6%.
* **Ethnic/Gender Skew:** Black customers dominate with a 43% share. This is primarily driven by a strong male presence (38% share) with an average age of 33.
* **Top Channels:** SuperSport Live Events leads total customer engagement with an 18% share. This success is heavily skewed toward the Male audience (15% share), who primarily rely on short-duration viewing.

## 📈 Strategic Recommendations
 **1. What content would you recommend to increase consumption on the days with low consumption? (Mon-Wed)**

* **Midweek Boost Campaigns:** Introduce short, exclusive releases or trending content drops early in the week to stabilize traffic.

* **Weekend Recap Segments:** Launch "Monday Recap" or "Wednesday Highlights" segments to re-engage audiences by summarizing weekend hits.

* **Targeted Promotion:** Run push notifications or app banners promoting new or trending videos specifically on Monday through Wednesday.

**2. What type of initiatives would you recommend to further grow BrightTV's User base?**

* **Content Investment:** Maximize Short-Form content investment (under 15 minutes) to align with the dominant viewer habit.

* **Peak-Time Prioritization:** Prioritize Friday-Saturday mornings & afternoons for major drops, new series, or campaign premieres to leverage peak windows.

**3. Maximize Channel Momentum:**

* SuperSport Live Events & ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, create related micro-content like "Best Moments" or "Player of the Week" to deepen retention.

* Use similar short-form strategies for entertainment channels like Channel O and Trace TV.

* Regional Expansion: Build community-focused content (e.g., local sports engagement) and expand entertainment, culture, and lifestyle content to attract new viewers beyond the current strongholds (Gauteng and Western Cape)
